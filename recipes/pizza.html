                    <li>1 ball Best Homemade Pizza Dough</li>
                    <li>⅓ cup Easy Pizza Sauce</li>
                    <li>3 ounces fresh mozzarella cheese (or about ¾ cup shredded mozzarella)</li>

                    <li>Prepare the dough using the Best Pizza Dough recipe.Follow the
                        preparation instructions in the dough recipe if prepared in advance.</li><br>
                    <li>Place a pizza stone in the oven and preheat to 500°F. OR preheat your pizza oven.</li><br>
                    <li>Make the Homemade Pizza Sauce.</li><br>
                    <li>Slice the mozzarella into ¼ inch thick pieces. If it's incredibly watery fresh mozzarella (all
                        brands vary), you may want to let it sit on a paper towel to remove moisture for about 15
                        minutes then dab the mozzarella with the paper towel to remove any additional moisture.</li><br>
                    <li>When the oven is ready, stretch the dough into a circle.
                        Sprinkle a pizza peel with semolina flour or cornmeal, then carefully place the dough on top.
                        Spread the pizza sauce across the dough. Top with mozzarella cheese. Taste a bite of the
                        mozzarella cheese; if it does
                        not taste salty, add a few pinches of kosher salt to the pizza.</li><br>
                    <li>If you're baking in a pizza oven, add the basil leaves. For baking in a standard oven, add the
                        basil leaves after you bake (the leaves turn black in a standard oven).</li><br>
                    <li>Transfer the pizza to the pizza stone on the pizza peel, then bake until the cheese is melted,
                        about 7 minutes in the oven (or 1 minute in the pizza oven). Slice into pieces and serve
                        immediately.
